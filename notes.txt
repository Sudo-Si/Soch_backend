*Images are Pins !*

 issues with the naming of schemas, have left postedBy2 as is because i had to individually import each one by , changing all the types that refed posted by to string then 
 change refs in save comment pin make sure user was imported with posted by then work my way up importing all of the schemas 

  Now we can create new users , pins with ref to users , comments , and you can save posts 






git config --global user.name "Sudo-Si"
git config --global user.email "dalgleishmaswabi@gmail.com.com"












create user.js file

` user.js`
// schema for the user 
{
    name: 'user',
    title:'User', 
    type: 'document',
    fields: [
        {
            name: 'useName',
            title: 'UserName',
            type: 'string'
        },
        {
            name: 'image',
            title: 'Image',
            type: 'string'
        }
    ]
}
